              Your resume should be no longer than 1-2 pages. Keep it to 1 page
              if you have less than 8 years of professional work experience. If
              you have more, you might consider using 2 pages.
            </li>
            <li>
              Include a skills section – it’s incredibly important. This step
              will prove highly valuable if the company uses ATS (applicant
              tracking system).
            </li>
            <li>
              Unless otherwise specified by the company or the job description,
              submit your resume in pdf format. You can convert this file to pdf
              in google docs by going to File, select Download, and then pdf.
            </li>
            <li>
              Write 2-5 bullet points for each position, depending on the
              duration and relevance of the position. Keep sections that are
              less relevant to the job you’re applying to short.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your most recent position should have the most bullet points, as
              long as the position is relevant to the one you’re applying for.
            </li>
            <li>
              Describe your existing role using the present continuous tense and
              describe past roles using the past simple tense.

              It’s not enough to describe what you have done or your areas of
              responsibility, you need to quantify the impact of your work.
              Recruiters scan resumes for numbers, so quantify as much as you
              can.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can talk about xx% improvement your initiatives yielded.
            </li>
            <li>
              Or you could mention the increase in company revenue of xx% that
              your work contributed to.
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid writing bullet points that are longer than 2 lines. No
              recruiter will read bullet points that are as long as paragraphs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Carefully review your resume several times to eliminate any typos.
              Additionally, consider having someone else proofread it to prevent
              sending an imperfect resume.

              Be consistent with grammar. Generally, resumes should be written
              in the past tense. The exception is if you’re describing your
              current position with ongoing responsibilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you’re a fresh grad with limited work experience you can move
              the education section to the top of the page.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have 5–8 years of work experience, do not include
              internship experience in your resume unless highly relevant.
